## v0.12.0 - Creme theme + design improvements  (Jan 28, 2025)
* add creme theme
* improved navigation bar design
* update PdfDing logo
* fix: adjusted background colors for the sidebar on mobile devices
       as the table of contents was not readable.
* fix: adjust dropdown open button color in the viewer

## v0.11.0 - Starring, Archiving, Thumbnails, Previews  (Jan 14, 2025)
* PDFs can be starred and archived. Starred and archived PDFs can be quickly accessed
  in the overview. Archived PDFs are hidden from the default overview.
* Add PDF previews. The first page of each PDF can be shown in the overview without
  entering the viewer.
* Support thumbnails in the overview. The first page of each PDF will be shown as a
  thumbnail in the overview. Thumbnails are disabled by default and can be activated
  in the user settings.

## 0.10.0 - Markdown Notes  (Jan 5, 2025)
* Add markdown notes to PDFs. The notes can be shown in the PDF overview.
* Add healthz endpoint. This endpoint is primarily used for restarting the demo instance
  every `x` minutes.
* Improve design of view shared PDF prompt page

## 0.9.1 - Demo Mode  (Jan 2, 2025)
* Introduce demo mode
* Add hover tooltips to the buttons of the viewer
* make parent-children relationships for tags in tree mode clearer by adding guiding lines
* Add PDF ID to details page
* minor UI improvements for PDF details page
* fix: Adjust viewer navigation bar for mobile devices
* fix: Display correct version in admin area. This did not work due to the migration from
  woodpacker to gh actions.

## 0.9.0 - Annotations, Highlighting and Drawings  (Dec 25, 2024)
* Add editing functionality to the PDF viewer. Users can add annotations, highlighting and drawings to PDFs
  and save them. More information can be found
  [here](https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing/blob/master/docs/guides.md#editing).
* Show pdf name as the site title.
* Update dependencies

## 0.8.0 - Tag Tree Mode (Dec 22, 2024)
* Add tree mode for tags. Pdfs can now be organized with hierarchical tags. Instructions
  can be found [here](https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing/blob/master/docs/guides.md#tags).
* Minor UI improvements

### Breaking Changes
* Due to the internal workings of the tree mode for tags, naming of tags had to be restricted.
  From now on tags can only contain letters, numbers, '/', '-' and '_'. Furthermore, names cannot
  start or end with '/' and consecutive occurrences of '/' are also not allowed. These restrictions
  are only enforced for newly created tags. For existing tags users will need to activate normal
  mode for tags and manually adjust the tags, so they are valid. Otherwise, tree mode will not work.

* Add consumption directory as an alternative way for adding PDF files
* Show user ID in the header dropdown menu

* Only display the progress bar if a PDF's number of pages are valid
* Set the current page in the reading progress to 0 if it is unopened

  this will fix some problems regarding this topic.
